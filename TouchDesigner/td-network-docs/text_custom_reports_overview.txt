Reports are any time series data that you wish to have graphed on the sudoSignals web dashboard.

Any report should be packaged into a table where column 0 contains the names for the metrics to be recorded, and column 1 contains the values you wish to be recorded. The base_reports example is included as a default, but users are encouraged to generate a table with the reports they wish to capture.

By default sudoSignals will send the following to your dashboard from a Perform CHOP:
- fps
- msec
- cpumsec
- gpu_mem_used
- total_gpu_mem
- cpu_mem_used
